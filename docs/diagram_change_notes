"AddressSnowflakeERC721" - Address Snowflake ERC721; Non-Fungible Token Standard basic implementation, but with address owning. In order to differentiate functions such "approve" and "transfer", the suffix "Address" has been added; thus, "approveAddress()" and "transferFromAddress" are expected to be the same implementation as their regularly named functions, simply meant for a token that can have addresses potentially approve tokens.

"AddressSnowflakeERC721Burnable" - Snowflake ERC721 Token that can be irreversibly burned (destroyed). 

Similar to its regular counterpart, it exposes the _burnAddress() function as:

function burnAddress(uint256 tokenId) public;
